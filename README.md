# El-Farol

## Exploring Complexity and RL
The El Farol problem could be cosidered the equivalent of MNIST for complexity research. For this project, I will start by creating a class creating the classical El Farol environment. I will later extend this by attempting to train an RL agent to try and improve on the agent's success outcome. This can be further extended to multi-agent cooperation/competition scenarios. I intend to use this as a testbed for testing out different ideas in complexity, game theroy, and multi-agent RL.
